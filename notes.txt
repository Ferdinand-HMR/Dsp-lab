demo 09 - Circular buffer (long buffer)

   - two versions: 

    From Lecture 03:
    1) buffer length = delay in samples
    buffer uses one index

    New in Lecture 04:
    2) buffer length > delay in samples
    buffer uses two indices
      one index for reading, one index for writing
    useful when delay is time-varying


demo 10 - Vibrato 

Vibrato
  - play_vibrato_simple.py
  - time-varyring delay
  - non-recursive 
  - no interpolation 
  - read wave file
	- save to wave file, write each block to wave file...
  - with interpolation 

  - more effects: flanger, chorus, etc


demo 11 - audio plotting

demo 12 - Guitar (Karplus-Strong algorithm)
