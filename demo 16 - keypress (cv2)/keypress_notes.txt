Keypress Notes

Demos:

waitkey_demo_01.py
  This demo waits for key press, then prints key value.  cv2 functions: odd, imread, imshow, waitKeywaitkey_demo_02.py
  This demo uses a loop to read multiple key presses.waitkey_demo_03.py  This demo also uses loop to read multiple key presses.
  In this demo the loop runs keeps running whether or not
  the user pressed a key.key_play.py
  This demo plays a sounds whenever the user presses a key.
  The waitKey command is used to detect when the user presses a key. 

cv2 is a Python library for computer vision using OpenCV. 

In these demos, we use cv2 for the purpose of its 'waitKey' command. cv2 can detect when a key on the keyboard is pressed using the function cv2.waitKey.  To use this function, an image should first be displayed on the screen.  The waitKey function waits for a specified amount of time for a key to be pressed.  waitKey(10) will wait for up to 10 milliseconds. If no key is pressed during that time, then waitKey returns a value of -1.  If a key is pressed, then waitKey returns a corresponding key number.  waitKey(0) will wait forever for a key to be pressed.

To installing cv2:

pip3 install opencv-python
or
pip install opencv-python
or
sudo pip3 install opencv-python
or
sudo pip install opencv-python

Another way to install cv2 is using Anaconda. Conda is a package manager, which allows for easy and quick installation of a lot of python libraries.

To download and install Anaconda:
https://conda.io/docs/download.html
https://conda.io/docs/install/full.html

To install Opencv with Anaconda, run the following command on the terminal:

conda install -c conda-forge opencv=3.2.0

or (if the above does not work)

conda install -c menpo opencv3=3.2.0
