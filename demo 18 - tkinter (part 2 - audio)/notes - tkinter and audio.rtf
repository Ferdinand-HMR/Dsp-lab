\cf0 \
These demos combine Tkinter and Pyaudio. The audio is adjusted via Tkinter through buttons, sliders, and the keyboard. \
\
In all these demos we use top.update() instead of top.mainloop(). We do not need a Tkinter loop, because there is already a loop for audio.\
\
Tk_demo_00_update\
   The .update function in Tkinter (alternative to .mainloop).\
\
Tk_demo_01_buttons.py\
   Use buttons to adjust the frequency of a sinusoid.\
\
Tk_demo_02_slider.py\
   Use a slider to adjust the frequency of a sinusoid.\
\
Tk_demo_03_slider.py\
   Use two sliders to adjust the frequency and gain of a sinusoid.\
\
Tk_demo_04_keyboard.py\
   Read characters from the keyboard\
\
Tk_demo_05_keyboard.py\
   Use the keyboard to adjust the frequency of a sinusoid.\
\
Tk_demo_06_keyboard.py\
   Use the keyboard to adjust the frequency of a sinusoid and display frequency.\
\
Tk_demo_07_keyboard.py\
   Use the keyboard to adjust both the frequency and gain of a sinusoid.\
\
Tk_demo_08_keyboard.py\
   Play a note (via difference equation) upon keypress.\
\

\b Exercises
\b0 \
\
1) In the demo program 
\i Tk_demo_03_slider.py
\i0 , whenever the gain slider is adjusted, a click sound can be heard, due to the discontinuity in signal waveform due to a sudden change in amplitude. Modify this program so there is no click (no signal discontinuity).\
2) Make real-time echo effect with slider to control delay time. Use circular buffer.\
2) Make real-time vibrato effect with sliders to control parameters (LFO, depth)\
3) Make real-time AM effect with sliders to control parameters (modulation frequency, gain)\

\b Create a stand-alone application\

\b0 \
A Python program can be converted into a stand-alone application using pyinstaller.\
\
http://www.pyinstaller.org/\
\
One way to install pyinstaller is to type one of the following in the terminal:\
\
pip install pyinstaller\
pip3 install pyinstaller\
\
To create a stand-alone application, type one of the following in the terminal window:\
\
pyinstaller python_file.py\
pyinstaller --onefile python_file.py\
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed python_file.py\
